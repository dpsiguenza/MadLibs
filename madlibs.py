### Below is how to create an empty list, add things to the list by input and loop through each item in the list and print it
### Next I want to create an empty list, ask for 5 nouns, put them in the list and call them each, then add them to the mad lib to print
# list =[]
# list.append(input("Give me something: "))
# list.append(input("Give me something else: "))

# for i in range(len(list)):
#     print(list[i])
